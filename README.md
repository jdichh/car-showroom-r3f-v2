# Gran Turismo Inspired Car Showroom Scene (v2)
 A car showroom mainly inspired by the one in Gran Turismo Sport, and made with React-Three-Fiber, Shadcn and Zustand. The old version (version 1) which was limited to only 1 car can be found [here](https://github.com/jdichh/car-showroom-R3F). <br/> <br/> Models and textures were sourced from CSR Racing 2 and edited with Blender.

## Demo

## Challenges Faced and How It Was Solved
<ul>
 <li>State management with React Context (for menu items, car paint states, current car state, etc.), used Zustand instead to simplify</li>
 <li>UI responsiveness, but it is not meant for mobile devices as it can be too performance-heavy for them (I just made the UI responsive in case a user's mobile device can run it properly.)</li>
</ul>

## Project setup
If you want to try this out for yourself, download the source code, open the folder in VSCode/VSCodium, and run these lines of code.
```
pnpm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
