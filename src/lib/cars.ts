    years of Alfa Romeo." In 2020, special editions of the Alfa Romeo Giulia were 
    introduced to celebrate the 110th anniversary of the historic company. The cars 
    were called the Giulia GTA and GTAm, which were based on the high-performance
    Quadrifoglio model. For these cars, the power output of the twin-turbocharged 
    2.9-liter V-6 was increased to 532.5 HP, while curb weight was reduced by 220 
    lbs. Also, the front and rear track were widened by 2.0 inches to enhance the 
    car's stability, while the cars' aerodynamics were significantly enhanced in 
    the form of new front and rear fenders, as well as other redesigned body parts, 
    thanks to help from Alfa Romeo's Formula 1 partner, Sauber. The GTAm offers a 
    more hardcore setup designed for circuit use. In addition to a larger front 
    splitter and carbon fiber rear wing, a roll-cage was installed and the rear 
    seats were removed.`,
