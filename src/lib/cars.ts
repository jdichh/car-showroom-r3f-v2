    description: `"The top-of-the-line model in the Giulia lineup celebrated 110
    years of Alfa Romeo." In 2020, special editions of the Alfa Romeo Giulia were 
    introduced to celebrate the 110th anniversary of the historic company. The cars 
    were called the Giulia GTA and GTAm, which were based on the high-performance
    Quadrifoglio model. For these cars, the power output of the twin-turbocharged 
    2.9-liter V-6 was increased to 532.5 HP, while curb weight was reduced by 220 
    lbs. Also, the front and rear track were widened by 2.0 inches to enhance the 
    car's stability, while the cars' aerodynamics were significantly enhanced in 
    the form of new front and rear fenders, as well as other redesigned body parts, 
    thanks to help from Alfa Romeo's Formula 1 partner, Sauber. The GTAm offers a 
    more hardcore setup designed for circuit use. In addition to a larger front 
    splitter and carbon fiber rear wing, a roll-cage was installed and the rear 
    seats were removed.`,

    description: `"The flagship model of Ferrari wasn't just fast, it was a 
    technological marvel." Ferrari unveiled its might new flagship, the F12 
    Berlinetta, in 2012 at the Geneva Motor Show. The successor to the 599 GTB 
    Fiorano featured a newly-designed base structure whose space frame and body 
    shell combined 12 different types of aluminum alloys. The front mid-mounted 
    engine came in the form of a naturally aspirated 6262 cc V-12 producing 
    729.7 HP and 509.9 ft-lb of peak torque, making it the most powerful Ferrari 
    road car to date. Impressive numbers, to be sure, but Ferrari spent a majority 
    of its development effort on the car's architecture. The F12 Berlinetta was 1.8 
    inches shorter, 0.7 inches narrower and 2.4 inches lower than its predecessor, 
    with a wheelbase that measured 1.1 inches less. The engine sat 1.1 inches lower 
    than the 599, and the dual clutch 7-speed F1-matic gearbox utilized a transaxle 
    layoutâ€”both of these features helped to lower the center of gravity by 0.9 inches 
    and established a nearly ideal front/rear weight ratio of 46:54. On the road, 
    the F12 Berlinetta, despite its elegant good looks, was an  absolute beast. 
    It ran from zero to 100 km/h in a phenomenal 3.1 seconds, getting to 200 km/h 
    in just 8.5, and topping out at a blurring 340 km/h. With its improved handling 
    balance, it set a new fastest road car lap around the Fiorano test track, 
    besting the 599 GTO by a full second. With refined aerodynamics, advanced 
    electronic devices and a brake cooling system that trickled down from its 
    Formula 1 race car, this prancing horse deserved to be the flagship for what 
    is arguably the most revered and recognized company in automotive history.`,

    description: `The Lamborghini Aventador LP 750-4 Superveloce, released in 
    2015, was the highest performance model of the Lamborghini lineup until the 
    rise of the Aventador S in 2016 which introduced major improvements. The 
    Superveloce (abbreviated SV) simply means 'Super Fast'. The SV designation 
    dates back to the famed Miura, and is a moniker that is given only to the 
    highest performance flagship models of Lamborghini. The 6.5 litre naturally 
    aspirated V12 engine of the LP 750-4 SV produces 49 BHP more power than the 
    standard Aventador at 739 BHP. Combined with a 7 speed semiautomatic 
    transmission and all wheel drive, it reaches 0-100 km/h in 2.8 seconds, 
    200 km/h in 8.6 seconds, and 300 km/h in 24.9 seconds. If you keep on the 
    throttle beyond this, the car will continue to accelerate to speeds in excess 
    of 350 km/h. It also shows incredible stopping performance with a 100 km/h-0 
    km/h braking distance of just 30 m. This model was to be a limited edition 
    with a production run of only 600 cars worldwide, but an open top LP 750-4 
    SV roadster was later sold in a limited production run of 500 cars.`,
